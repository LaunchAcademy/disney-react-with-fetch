## Disney Fetch in React

Goals:
*   Movies stored in `movies.json` should be displayed when the user visits the root path
*   App should include a form that displays on the root path as well
*   Submitting the form should add movies to the "database"
*   List of movies on main page should update immediately on form submission, without requiring a page refresh
